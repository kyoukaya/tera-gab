Maybe playwith will fix their overzealous censorship right? Haha.

## Config
Doesn't modify outgoing packets by default, only decensoring inbound packets,
i.e. other people will not be able to see your words uncensored, but you will
see everyone's works as uncensored. You can change this behaviour by modifying
the ```"outgoingEnabled": false``` line in ```config.json```.

## Usage
Automically on by default. Or you can activate it manually with ```/8 gab on```
