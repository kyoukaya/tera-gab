Maybe playwith will fix their overzealous censorship right? Haha.

## Client-side Chat Decensor
Unzip `client_mod/DownloadedResources.zip` and replace the exiting `DownloadedResources.dat` file in `TERA\TERA-CLIENT\S1Game\S1Data`. You may wish to make a backup of the original, but if you want a fresh copy of the original file you can just delete it and the launcher will download a new one.

## Usage
Automically on by default. Or you can activate it manually with ```/8 gab on```. Only decensors words in the filter list found in `data\censored_words.json`
